# This is my project for ETH Proof: Intermediate EVM course module 1 by Metacrafters.

In this I have written a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements using the solidity programming language which are used for error handling and control flow within smart contracts.

- The require statement is used to validate conditions and ensure that specific conditions are met before proceeding with the execution of a function.
- The assert statement is primarily used to check for internal errors and should not be used for regular error handling.
- The revert statement is used to revert the current transaction, effectively undoing any changes made within the function.
